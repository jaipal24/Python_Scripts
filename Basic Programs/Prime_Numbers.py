# Given two positive integers start and end.
# The task is to write a Python program to print all Prime numbers in an Interval.
# Definition: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
# The first few prime numbers are {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, â€¦.}.
# The idea to solve this problem is to iterate the val from start to end using a for loop and for every number,
# if it is greater than 1, check if it divides n.
# If we find any other number which divides, print that value.
